## Purpose of Website

> This website was developed in my COMP1006 Intro to Web Programming course at Georgian College.
I was asked to create a website based on my interests, so I chose to create a website that
adds players to a database.


1. This website implements 
2. RUD functionalities.
3. Register/login pages.
4. Securing pages via authentication.
5. Search and sort features
6. APIs.

## Technologies Learned

- PHP
- mySQL
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript

## Launch

- Visit [my project's website](https://lamp.computerstudi.es/~Emilio200478144/php-term2/week12/myproject/login.php) and feel free to register/login to play around

To launch this, you'll have to clone my Github files to your PHP server, change the credentials listed in db_cred.php, and run my .sql scripts in your mysql database.
